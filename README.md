# Snake Game

One more classic game for your entertainment *lol*. The concept originated in the 1976 two-player Blockade from Gremlin Industries, but for my generation it became known for it Nokia 1998 mobile phone's variant.
The player controls the snake with the arrows on the keyboard, and the objective is to eat as many apples (red dots) as possible without hitting it's tail or the edges of the game screen.
